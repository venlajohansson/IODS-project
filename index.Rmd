# Introduction to Open Data Science - Course Project
I am __excited__ about this course. I have some previous experience in R, but the course I participated in the last time, was too advanced for me. I hope that during this course I learn to manage R and utilize some basic statistical analyses. In the future I'd like to utilize R with bioinformatics.

Ps. Here's a link to my github repository [link](https://github.com/venlajohansson?tab=repositories)
```{r child = "chapter1.Rmd"}
# This will include Chapter 1 (that is updated in its own file) in the document.
```
  
***
  
```{r child = "chapter2.Rmd"}
# This will include Chapter 2 (that is updated in its own file) in the document.
```

***

(more chapters to be added similarly as we proceed with the course!)
