# About the project

*Write a short description about the course and add a link to your GitHub repository here. This is an R Markdown (.Rmd) file so you should use R Markdown syntax.*

I am __excited__ about this course. I have some previous experience in R, but the course I participated in the last time, was too advanced for me. I hope that during this course I learn to manage R and utilize some basic statistical analyses. In the future I'd like to utilize R with bioinformatics.

Ps. Here's a link to my github repository [link](https://github.com/venlajohansson?tab=repositories)

Pss. trying to solve why my git repository is not updating.
